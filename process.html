                <p><i>Our methodical, precise and much practiced approach to interior design and commercial fit out
                        ensures a timely and cost effective service for your business. We like to make the process as
                        fast, efficient and inspiring for our clients as we can.</i></p>
                <p><i>Refurbishments can really inject a new lease of life into your workplace, employees and visitors â€“
                        we like to make it a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.</i></p>
                <p><i>We generally follow the process listed below but this can be tweaked according to your
                        requirements, some projects do not require all of the below and some projects require more. We
                        have worked within the commercial fit-out and interiors industry for over 40 years and we
                        understand that all projects and companies are individual and have different requirements
                        depending on the work and scale involved.</i></p>

                <p><i>In order for us to make a real difference we need to fully understand what you would like to
                        achieve from your office refurbishment. We will sit down with you and discuss your aims and
                        vision for your new interior. Once we understand your goals we will conduct a site survey and
                        suggest some initial ideas.</i></p>

                <h5>SPACE-PLANNING</h5>
                <p><i>Space planning is paramount in making sure the overall area and flow of the workplace can perform
                        as it needs to. Space-planning also helps with future planning and highlights any potential
                        problem areas. Fire escape routes and disabled access can also be reviewed whilst space
                        planning. We initially produce 2D layouts which are great to work with until the design is
                        right, we can then look at producing 3D visuals to really bring your project to life.</i></p>

                <h5>FIXTURES, FITTINGS AND FINISHES</h5>
                <p><i>Fixtures, fittings and finishes generally begin to be discussed during the planning stage as these
                        can influence which products are specified. As interior designers we will advise as much or as
                        little as you like in order to pull the whole scheme together and really create that wow factor
                        whilst still keeping your workplace functioning at its optimum levels.</i></p>

                <h5>THE TECHNICAL STUFF</h5>
                <p><i>Once a final design has been agreed upon, we will look at the best way to conduct the works.
                        Should this be during normal working hours, a quiet period within your business, out of hours
                        completely (evenings and weekends) or we can look at phasing the works over a period of time. We
                        will work with you to ensure there is as minimum disruption to your business activities as
                        possible. This is the stage where we will put together a full programme of works, we will ensure
                        all health & safety policies and procedures are in place including method statements and risk
                        assessments. We will get everything organised from our side so that we are ready to start work
                        on the agreed date, with our trusted tradesmen working consecutively.</i></p>

                <h5>TRANSFORMATION</h5>
                <p><i>The exiting bit that everyone looks forward to! Inevitably works get messy before they get pretty
                        (we have great ways to manage mess during a refurbishment by the way) but trust us it is worth
                        it! Commercial refurbishments can make such a huge difference, not just visually, they can give
                        your whole team a boost and your office interiors are often the first impression your visitors
                        get of your company - make sure it is a good one!</i></p>
